Security Advisory Alerter
=========================

This is just a simple proof of concept program that given a list of security
advisories and known device assets, will attempt to identify if the asset is
vulnerable to the provided advisories.

The key steps are as follows:
1. Identify if the device is running vulnerable version of software
2. identify if the device is running the affected feature

Current version is for demo only and cannot read in real data.
